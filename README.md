# Application: C2M-Management-System
Welcome to Card2Manage System! This application aims to assist Card2Cart owners in their inventory, transaction, and package monitoring. The application offers additional
support for users, including Username Recovery, Password Recovery, and an option to enable Two-Factor Authentication. The application presents three main management

their packages. The team Green Hornets are pushing/uploading their codes here to fulfill the requirements in Card2Manage System.
